**Project Title:**
NYC 311 Complaint Analysis and Prediction

**Description:**
This project is part of the IBM Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project, where I applied various data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize the data set of New York City's 311 complaint system. The aim was to build a predictive model to understand and forecast the trends in non-emergency complaints in NYC. This involved data ingestion, exploration, visualization, feature engineering, probabilistic modeling, and model validation.

**Objectives:**
- To apply knowledge of data science and machine learning in a real-life scenario.
- Analyze and visualize 311 complaint data using Python.
- Perform feature engineering and build a predictive machine learning model.
- Create and share actionable insights to address the increasing 311 complaints in NYC.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python for data analysis and machine learning
- Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn
- Data from the New York City Open Dataset

**Outcome:**
This capstone project showcases my ability to handle real-world data science problems, demonstrating skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model building, readying me for challenges in the data science job market.
